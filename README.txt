Name: Adam Paul

Starting the week of August 30th, I plan to spend 3 hours or more per week on this Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning course
in order to finish it in a timely manner. Since this course is approximately 40 hours long, this puts my estimated completion
date at week 15 of the fall semester. (40/3 = 13.33)
