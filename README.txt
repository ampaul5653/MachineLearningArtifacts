Name: Adam Paul

Starting the week of August 30th, I plan to spend 3 hours or more per week on this Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning course
in order to finish it in a timely manner. Since this course is approximately 40 hours long, this puts my estimated completion
date at week 15 of the fall semester. (40/3 = 13.33)

Week 1 Update (Week of August 30th): Module 1 of course completed.

Week 2 Update (Week of September 6th): Module 2 of course completed. Module 1&2 quiz completed with a score of 13/15. Would have been 14/15 were the first question I got wrong not phrased poorly.
