Name: Adam Paul

Starting the week of August 30th, I plan to spend 3 hours or more per week on this Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning course
in order to finish it in a timely manner. Since this course is approximately 40 hours long, this puts my estimated completion
date at week 15 of the fall semester. (40/3 = 13.33)

Week 1 Update (Week of August 30th): Module 1 of course completed.

Week 2 Update (Week of September 6th): Module 2 of course completed. Module 1&2 quiz completed with a score of 13/15. Would have been 14/15 were the first question I got wrong not phrased poorly.

Week 7 Update (Week of October 11th): Module 3 completed last week, aside from the Yes/No game. IntelliJ IDEA project uploaded reflecting this. Though I plan to work on and complete the Yes/No game within the next couple of weeks, I plan to move on to module 4 (the final one) in the meantime to avoid work piling up. The course gave me very little to work with when it comes to creating the Yes/No game, effectively telling me to create the machine learning part without ever teaching me how, so I've been a bit stumped here.

Week 15 Update (Week of November 22nd) : Module 4 completed with a 15/15 on the chapter 3 + 4 quiz and a 48/50 on the final exam. The Yes/No game has been completed and is located within the uploaded project. Uploaded classes have been finalized and notes from the course have also been uploaded. Didn't take notes in module 3 outside of code, as it was mostly information I have in my Discrete Mathematics notes.
